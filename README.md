#Groundnets
FlightGear groundnet files initially based on X-Plane Scenery Gateway airport .dat file taxi routes and parking positions. If no airport taxi route and/or all airport parking positions did not exist in the X-Plane Scenery Gateway airport .dat file, the file was edited in World Editor (WED) to include a taxi route and all parking positions. After this, M-Herweg's conversion scripts aptdat2sqlite.py and sqlite2xml.py were used to obtain draft groundnets. These groundnets were modified using TaxiDraw until acceptable behavior in FlightGear was achieved. In addition, parking positions (ramp starts in X-Plane) were added as necessary and/or positions were modified to include airline gate assignments using actual data available at the time of modification on websites such as Flightview.com and FlightAware.com.
